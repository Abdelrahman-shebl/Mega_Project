steps:

Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi:

Open the Raspberry Pi configuration file by running the command: sudo raspi-config
Navigate to "Interfacing Options" and select "I2C."
Choose "Yes" to enable the I2C interface.
Reboot the Raspberry Pi for the changes to take effect.
Connect the PCA9685 to the Raspberry Pi:

Connect the VCC pin of the PCA9685 to the 3.3V power supply on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the GND pin of the PCA9685 to any ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the SDA pin of the PCA9685 to the SDA pin (GPIO 2) on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the SCL pin of the PCA9685 to the SCL pin (GPIO 3) on the Raspberry Pi.
Optionally, connect an external power supply to the V+ and GND pins of the PCA9685 if you require more power for your devices.
Install the required software libraries:

Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
Copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-smbus
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
Verify the I2C connection:

Run the command sudo i2cdetect -y 1 to check if the PCA9685 is detected. You should see its address (0x40 by default) listed on the grid.
